## Details

Enter the epic story of our world, where a glaring imbalance steals the show: the drama of pollution,

This narrative features two casts. On one side stand the culprits—affluent nations draped in their hefty carbon footprints, the ostentatious generators of pollutants. On the opposing front, the poor nations grappling with the harsh realities of climate change

According to data, around 58% of global emissions are attributable to the richest 10% of the population. The harshest aspect of this is that those who have contributed the least to the issue are the ones who are most affected.

However, the story is far from over. Now is the opportune moment to rewrite the narrative, ushering in the era of Decarbonify—a revolutionary blockchain based carbon trading platform

## What it does
Essentially, carbon trading is a mechanism that allows businesses to purchase and sell credits or permits that allow them to emit a certain quantity of carbon dioxide (CO2).

- Each country receives an initial cap of 100 carbon credits upon registering into the Decarbonify platform. This cap acts as a concrete ceiling on the amount of emissions that the nation is allowed to emit over a given period of time. 
- Companies operating within the Decarbonify can request carbon credits from their respective country's credit pool. 
- The request is then carefully examined by the relevant nation's environmental authorities. This entails a careful evaluation of the business's sustainability programmes and emissions statistics. 
- The country retains the discretionary power to either approve or reject the company's credit request.
- In instances where a country has a shortage of available carbon credits for allocation, it possesses the flexibility to acquire additional credits from other countries 
- Conversely, nations endowed with surplus credits can choose to make them available for purchase by others
