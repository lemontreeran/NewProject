## Inspiration
Step into the epic tale of our planet, where a stark inequality commands the spotlight: the unfolding drama of pollution, a pervasive global crisis that casts a formidable shadow across the entire expanse of Earth.

Within this sweeping saga, the ensemble is sharply divided into two distinct roles. On one side stand the culprits—affluent nations draped in their hefty carbon footprints, the ostentatious generators of pollutants. On the opposing front, our unsung heroes—nations grappling with the harsh realities of climate change, burdened by the weight of their circumstances.

The compelling data paints a vivid picture, revealing that the wealthiest 10% of the global population is responsible for nearly 58% of global emissions. Adding a layer of cruelty to this narrative is the fact that the least affluent have contributed minimally to the predicament yet bear the brunt of its impacts most profoundly.

However, do not succumb to despair, for the tale is far from its conclusion. Now is the opportune moment to rewrite the narrative, ushering in the era of Decarbonify—a revolutionary approach to flipping the script.

## What it does
In its essence, carbon trading constitutes a system that enables companies to engage in the buying and selling of permits or credits, granting them the right to emit a specific amount of carbon dioxide (CO2).

Upon integration into the Decarbonify platform, each country is endowed with an initial cap of 100 carbon credits. This cap serves as a tangible limit on the permissible emissions for the country within a specified timeframe.
Companies operating within the Decarbonify ecosystem can formally request carbon credits from their respective country's credit pool.
Subsequently, the environmental authorities of the concerned country meticulously scrutinize the request. This scrutiny involves a thorough assessment of the company's emissions data and sustainability initiatives, determining the alignment of the request with overarching climate goals.
The country retains the discretionary power to either approve or reject the company's credit request.

In instances where a country confronts a shortage of available carbon credits for allocation, it possesses the flexibility to acquire additional credits from other countries participating in the Decarbonify network.

Conversely, nations endowed with surplus credits can choose to make them available for purchase by others within the network
